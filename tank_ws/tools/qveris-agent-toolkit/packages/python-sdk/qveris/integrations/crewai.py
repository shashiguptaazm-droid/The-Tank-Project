"""CrewAI adapter for QVeris.

Exposes the QVeris ``discover`` / ``inspect`` / ``call`` workflow as CrewAI
tools, so a CrewAI agent can find and invoke thousands of external capabilities
through one QVeris API key.

    pip install "qveris[crewai]"

    from crewai import Agent
    from qveris import QverisClient
    from qveris.integrations.crewai import get_qveris_tools, aclose

    client = QverisClient()
    agent = Agent(role="Researcher", goal="...", backstory="...",
                  tools=get_qveris_tools(client))
    # ... run your crew synchronously (crew.kickoff()), then:
    aclose(client)

CrewAI executes tools synchronously; these tools bridge to the async QVeris
client on a single dedicated background event loop, so they work under both
``crew.kickoff()`` and ``crew.kickoff_async()``. Because the client's async
resources bind to that loop, close it with :func:`aclose` (which runs on the
same loop) rather than ``await client.close()``. Tools return JSON strings and
thread ``search_id`` from discover into inspect/call.
