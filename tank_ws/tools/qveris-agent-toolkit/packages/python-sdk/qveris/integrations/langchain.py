"""LangChain adapter for QVeris.

Exposes the QVeris ``discover`` / ``inspect`` / ``call`` workflow as LangChain
tools, so an agent built on LangChain (or LangGraph) can find and invoke
thousands of external capabilities through one QVeris API key.

    pip install "qveris[langchain]"

    from qveris import QverisClient
    from qveris.integrations.langchain import get_qveris_tools

    client = QverisClient()
    tools = get_qveris_tools(client)   # 3 async LangChain tools
    # bind `tools` to a LangChain / LangGraph agent, then close the client when done

The tools are async (use ``ainvoke`` / an async agent executor). They return
JSON strings — the same payloads the model sees in the built-in QVeris agent —
and thread ``search_id`` from discover into inspect/call the way the tool
descriptions instruct.
