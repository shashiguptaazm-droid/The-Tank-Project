"""OpenAI Agents SDK adapter for QVeris.

Exposes the QVeris ``discover`` / ``inspect`` / ``call`` workflow as OpenAI
Agents SDK function tools, so an ``agents.Agent`` can find and invoke thousands
of external capabilities through one QVeris API key.

    pip install "qveris[openai-agents]"

    from agents import Agent, Runner
    from qveris import QverisClient
    from qveris.integrations.openai_agents import get_qveris_tools

    client = QverisClient()
    agent = Agent(name="Assistant", tools=get_qveris_tools(client))
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Find a stock quote capability and quote AAPL.")
    await client.close()

Tool arguments and results mirror the built-in QVeris agent: discover returns a
``search_id`` that inspect/call thread through. Tools return JSON strings.
