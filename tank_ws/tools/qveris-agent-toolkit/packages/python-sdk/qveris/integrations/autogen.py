"""AutoGen adapter for QVeris.

Exposes the QVeris ``discover`` / ``inspect`` / ``call`` workflow as AutoGen
``FunctionTool`` objects.

    # pass `tools` to an AutoGen agent, then `await client.close()` when done

The tools are async and return JSON strings. A discover response's
``search_id`` can be threaded through inspect and call.
