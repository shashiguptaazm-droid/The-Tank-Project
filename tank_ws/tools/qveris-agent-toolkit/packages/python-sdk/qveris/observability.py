"""Optional OpenTelemetry tracing for the QVeris SDK.

Instrumenting ``discover`` / ``inspect`` / ``call`` emits one span each, with
attributes (``tool_id``, ``search_id``, ``execution_id``, ``elapsed_time_ms``,
``credits``) so a trace can be correlated with the QVeris usage/ledger records.

Tracing is **opt-in and dependency-free by default**:

- If ``opentelemetry-api`` is not installed (``pip install qveris[otel]`` adds it),
  every helper here is a no-op — zero overhead, zero behaviour change.
- If it is installed but no tracer provider/exporter is configured, spans are
  created against OpenTelemetry's default no-op provider (still effectively free).
- Configure an OTLP exporter in your app and the spans flow to Jaeger, Tempo,
  or any OTLP backend.

Nothing here records the natural-language ``query`` or tool parameters, to avoid
leaking user input into traces.
