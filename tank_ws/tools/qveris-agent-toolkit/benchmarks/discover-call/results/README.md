# Published benchmark results

## 2026-07-24 — corrected v2 official configured-model baseline

This is the first official configured-model baseline collected with benchmark
methodology `discover-call-v2`. It compares the curated reference route and
`gpt-5.6-sol` over immutable `tasks/v4.jsonl`: 18 tasks, three trials per task,
Top 10 discovery, and real calls. No failed trial was removed or selectively
rerun. Public artifacts were generated from the complete private records with
`public-artifact-v1`.

| Metric | Curated reference route | `gpt-5.6-sol` configured model |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Runs | 54 | 54 |
| Completed and executed | 51 / 54 | 52 / 54 |
| Selection grounded | 94.44% | 100% |
| Inspection grounded | 94.44% | 100% |
| Required-parameter accuracy | 100% | 100% |
| Constraint accuracy | 94.44% | 88.89% |
| Call success among attempted calls | 100% (51 / 51) | 100% (52 / 52) |
| Result non-empty among successful calls | 100% (51 / 51) | 100% (52 / 52) |
| Strict workflow success | 94.44% (51 / 54) | 88.89% (48 / 54) |
| Task-cluster bootstrap 95% interval | 83.33%–100% | 72.22%–100% |

The strict benchmark gap is **3 / 54 = 5.56 percentage points**. It is an
end-to-end benchmark difference, not a pure model-routing effect: the
sequential lanes observed different live Top-10 catalog snapshots. Their
intervals also overlap, so this 18-task baseline is not a claim of a
statistically significant difference.

The reference route's three strict failures are all `timezone-tokyo` coverage
misses. The configured model completed and returned successful non-empty calls
for all three Tokyo trials, but the selected capability accepted no Tokyo
input, so they remain constraint failures. For `domain-intel`, two trials were
safely rejected as `tool_use_rejected`; the remaining trial called
successfully but did not encode the requested domain, producing one additional
constraint failure. The configured model revision is unreported, so this is
not a pinned-model snapshot.

## 2026-07-23 — v4 diagnostic baseline candidate

This v4 run compares the curated reference route and the configured model
over immutable `tasks/v4.jsonl`: 18 tasks, three trials per task, Top 10
discovery, and real calls. All 54 trials in each lane are retained.
Public run records omit raw parameter values and retain only their scored
required-parameter and constraint-accuracy attestations. Inspected parameter
names are also omitted.

A later collector audit found that this run's `result_nonempty` implementation
tested the full `result` wrapper rather than its `result.data` payload. A
standard wrapper such as `{"data":{}}` was therefore classified as non-empty.
Raw result bodies were intentionally not retained, so the affected attestations
cannot be recomputed. The call-success and pre-result component metrics remain
diagnostic, but result non-emptiness, strict workflow success, its interval, and
the strict benchmark gap below are historical outputs rather than an official
quality baseline. Promotion requires a new run under a toolkit revision that
checks `result.data` and explicitly requests `respond_with: "full"`.

| Metric | Curated reference route | `gpt-5.6-sol` configured model |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Runs | 54 | 54 |
| Completed and executed | 51 / 54 | 51 / 54 |
| Selection grounded | 94.44% | 100% |
| Inspection grounded | 94.44% | 100% |
| Required-parameter accuracy | 100% | 100% |
| Constraint accuracy | 94.44% | 88.89% |
| Call success among attempted calls | 100% (51 / 51) | 88.24% (45 / 51) |
| Historical wrapper-level non-empty observation | 100% (51 / 51) | 88.24% (45 / 51) |
| Historical strict workflow output | 94.44% (51 / 54) | 77.78% (42 / 54) |
| Historical workflow interval | 83.33%–100% | 55.56%–94.44% |

The historical v4 strict benchmark gap output is **16.66 percentage points**.
It must not be presented as a current quality baseline. Independently, it is an
end-to-end difference rather than a pure routing effect: the two sequential
lanes observed different live Top-10 catalog snapshots, as recorded by their
different catalog-observation digests.

The reference route's three failures are the expected `timezone-tokyo`
coverage misses; its 51 attempted calls all reported success. The configured
model has 12 historical strict failures: three Tokyo constraint misses, three
IP lookup call failures, three company-profile call failures, and three
domain-intelligence `tool_use_rejected` adapter failures. All three Bitcoin
constraint checks pass in v4, confirming that the task-versioned `id=1` mapping
removed the known v3 scoring false negative.

## 2026-07-23 — v3 diagnostic comparison

This diagnostic run compares the curated reference route and a configured model
over the same 18 tasks, three trials per task, Top 10 discovery limit, and real
QVeris calls. No failed trial was removed or selectively rerun. It is not the
official quality baseline because v3 has a known Bitcoin constraint-scoring
false negative. It also predates the `result.data` collector correction
described above, so its result-non-empty and strict workflow outputs remain
historical diagnostics.

| Metric | Curated reference route | `gpt-5.6-sol` configured model |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Runs | 54 | 54 |
| Completed and executed | 51 / 54 | 52 / 54 |
| Selection grounded | 94.44% | 100% |

| Required-parameter accuracy | 100% | 100% |
| Constraint accuracy | 94.44% | 83.33% |
| Call success among attempted calls | 100% (51 / 51) | 88.46% (46 / 52) |
| Historical wrapper-level non-empty observation | 100% (51 / 51) | 88.46% (46 / 52) |
| Historical strict workflow output | 94.44% (51 / 54) | 72.22% (39 / 54) |
| Historical workflow interval | 83.33%–100% | 50.00%–88.89% |

The v3 strict benchmark gap is **22.22 percentage points**: curated reference
route 94.44% minus configured model 72.22%. It includes three Bitcoin false
negatives: successful non-empty calls used the provider-specific `id=1`, while
v3 accepted only values containing `BTC`. Therefore this gap is diagnostic,
not a publishable model-routing delta.

### v3 diagnostic interpretation

The curated reference route's three historical strict failures are all `timezone-tokyo`:
the fixed discovery query returned no Top 10 capability that accepts a city or
coordinates. All 51 reference-selected calls reported success.

The configured model also missed Tokyo semantically in all three trials: it
selected a successful timezone-list capability with no Tokyo input. Six well-formed
calls returned `success: false`: three selected
`weather_api.ip_lookup.retrieve.v1.e095d904`, and three selected
`tradefeeds.compinfo.retrieve.v1.c2314765`. Two domain-intelligence
parameterization attempts were rejected because the isolated model session
tried to use a disabled external tool; the remaining trial called the selected
tool with `{}` and therefore missed the domain constraint.

Three cryptocurrency calls succeeded and returned Bitcoin result wrappers via
CoinMarketCap's provider-specific numeric `id=1`, but the deterministic task
constraint expects a parameter value containing `BTC`; these remain strict
constraint misses rather than being silently reclassified after the run. This
known identifier-mapping limitation is fixed in immutable `tasks/v4.jsonl`.
The v3 records remain unchanged in meaning.

## 2026-07-23 — `gpt-5.6-sol` historical v2 baseline

This is the first controlled result for the versioned `tasks/v2.jsonl` contract
benchmark. It contains 18 tasks, three trials per task, and real QVeris calls.
No failed trial was removed or selectively rerun.

### Interpretation

The component metrics have different denominators. Call success is 44 of the 50
attempted calls. The original v2 scorer counted 35 of all 54 trials after
grounded selection and inspection, complete required parameters, task
constraints, and call success. That historical result predates result-content
observation, so the 44 successful calls cannot be assumed to have non-empty
results. The current scorer reports the pre-result-gate rate separately and
leaves strict workflow success and its interval unavailable.

The four adapter-stage failures were retained: all three domain-intelligence
trials selected a catalog capability whose inspected contract exposed no usable
domain parameter, and the final earthquake trial reached the 120-second adapter
timeout during parameterization. The adapter intentionally records only a safe,
generic failure at this boundary, so no more specific model event can be
attributed to that original trial. Six well-formed calls returned
`success: false`: all three IP lookup trials and all three company-profile
trials.

Constraint misses include three valid `symbol=USD/EUR` executions that the
current v2 alias scorer does not split into separate base/quote constraints,
three URL-encoded news queries, and three timezone-list selections that executed
successfully but did not accept Tokyo as an input. These details are why the
strict workflow metric should not be interpreted as API availability alone.

All checked-in run files are sanitized public artifacts produced under
`public-artifact-v1`. They omit execution/search/connection identifiers and the
ordered discovery catalog. Raw operational records are not stored in this
repository.
